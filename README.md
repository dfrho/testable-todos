### `A React Testing Workout via Udemy`
To start your own testing workout check out out [React Testing](https://www.udemy.com/share/101VMUAEETCLPQ) for more information.

### `Yes, Another Note-Taking App`
But this time with full Enzyme and Jest test suites, for practice. Clone or fork, install, then follow __yarn start__ and __yarn test__ scripts in *package.json*.

### Thanks again to Facebook and the Create React App team
...because this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
